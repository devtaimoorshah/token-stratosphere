# Token-Stratosphere Deployment Guide

This README provides a comprehensive guide to deploying your contract on the DuKong Testnet using TypeScript. You will deploy a CosmWasm contract written in Rust and interact with it via a TypeScript deployment script. The deployment process works across Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Follow this guide to deploy your contract and verify it on the MANTRA Chain Explorer.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** installed for compiling CosmWasm contracts.
- **Node.js** (with npm) for running deployment scripts.
- **Docker** to use the CosmWasm optimizer.
- **OM test tokens** in your wallet to cover gas fees and contract instantiation costs.
- A configured **mnemonic** for your wallet and RPC endpoint for DuKong Testnet.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Install Rust

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install Rust:
    ```bash
    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```
2. Follow the prompts during installation. Choose the default installation option to install Rust on your system.

### Set Rust to Stable Version

Run the following command to set Rust to the stable version:
```bash
$ rustup default stable
```

### Verify Cargo Installation

Cargo is the Rust package manager, which should be installed by default. Verify its installation:
```bash
$ cargo --version
```

### Add WebAssembly Target

CosmWasm contracts need to be compiled into WebAssembly (WASM) format. Add the WASM target to Rust:
```bash
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Install cargo-generate

`cargo-generate` is used to generate new Rust projects from templates. Install it using:
```bash
$ cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
```

## Boilerplate Setup

We will use a boilerplate project to manage our contract.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the boilerplate:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devtaimoorshah/token-stratosphere.git
```

### Check Dependencies

Open the `Cargo.toml` file in the root directory of your project and ensure the following dependencies are added:
```toml
[dependencies]
cw20-base = { version = "0.13.2", features = ["library"] }
cw20 = "2.0.0"
cw-utils = "0.12.1"
cosmwasm-std = "1.0.0"
cosmwasm-storage = "1.1.1"
cw-storage-plus = "0.15.0"
cw2 = "0.15.0"
schemars = "0.8.10"
serde = { version = "1.0.144", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
thiserror = { version = "1.0.31" }
cosmwasm-schema = "1.1.4"
prost = "0.12"
```

## Build and Deploy the Contract

### Build the Contract

1. Open the terminal in your project directory and run the following Docker command to optimize your contract:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
    --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
    --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
    cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
    ```
   This will generate necessary artifacts including the `.wasm` file.

### Deployment Script Setup

1. Create a `deployer` folder to manage the deployment scripts:
    ```bash
    mkdir deployer
    ```

2. Navigate to the `deployer` folder and initialize a new Node.js project:
    ```bash
    cd deployer
    npm init -y
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install typescript --save-dev
    npx tsc --init
    npm install @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate
    npm install @cosmjs/proto-signing @cosmjs/stargate dotenv fs
    ```

4. Ensure the `package.json` in the `deployer` folder includes the following dependencies:
    ```json
    "dependencies": {
        "@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate": "^0.32.4",
        "@cosmjs/proto-signing": "^0.32.4",
        "@cosmjs/stargate": "^0.32.4",
        "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
        "fs": "^0.0.1-security"
    }
    ```

5. Manually copy the `.wasm` file from your artifacts folder into the `deployer` folder.

### Create the Deployment Script

Create a new `index.ts` file inside the `deployer` folder with the following content:

```typescript
const { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } = require("@cosmjs/proto-signing");
const { SigningCosmWasmClient, CosmWasmClient } = require("@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate");
const { coins, GasPrice } = require("@cosmjs/stargate");
const fs = require("fs");
require("dotenv").config();

const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC; // Replace with your mnemonic
const rpcEndpoint = "https://rpc.dukong.mantrachain.io"; // RPC endpoint for your chain
const contractWasmPath = "./stratocoin.wasm"; // Path to your Stratocoin contract(wasm file)

async function deploy() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Set up wallet and client
    const wallet = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic, {
      prefix: "mantra", // Replace with the correct prefix for your chain
    });
    const [account] = await wallet.getAccounts();
    console.log(`Wallet address: ${account.address}`);

    // Step 2: Connect to the blockchain with the correct gasPrice denom
    const client = await SigningCosmWasmClient.connectWithSigner(
      rpcEndpoint,
      wallet,
      { gasPrice: GasPrice.fromString("0.01uom") } // Correct denom here: uom
    );
    console.log("Connected to blockchain");

    // Step 3: Upload contract
    const wasmCode = fs.readFileSync(contractWasmPath); // Using the path to stratocoin.wasm
    const uploadReceipt = await client.upload(
      account.address,
      wasmCode,
      "auto", // Automatically manage gas limit
      "Upload Stratocoin Contract"
    );
    const codeId = uploadReceipt.codeId;
    console.log(`Contract uploaded with Code ID: ${codeId}`);

    // Step 4: Instantiate contract with proper feeAmount
    const initMsg = {
      token_name: "StratoCoin",
      symbol: "STRAT",
      denom: "ustrat",
      decimals: 6,
      total_supply: "1000000000000000",
      initial_circulating_supply: "100000000000000",
      distribution: {
        validators: "400000000000000",
        community_reserve: "300000000000000",
        staking_rewards: "200000000000000",
        liquidity_provision: "50000000000000",
        foundation: "50000000000000",
      },
      inflation: {
        rate: 0.14, // Change from "14%" to 0.14
        decay_rate: 0.5,
        decay_time: "365 days",
        min_inflation: 0.07, // Change from "7%" to 0.07
        capped: true,
      },
      governance: {
        staking_requirement: "1000000 ustrat",
        voting_power: "1 token = 1 vote",
        quorum: 0.334, // Change from "33.4%" to 0.334
        threshold: 0.5, // Change from "50%" to 0.5
      },
      staking: {
        unbonding_time: "14 days",
        max_validators: 150,
        reward_distribution: "pro_rata",
      },
      liquidity_pools: [
        { pair: "STRAT/OSMO", pool_type: "default" },
        { pair: "STRAT/ATOM", pool_type: "default" },
      ],
      ibc_channels: [
        { target_chain: "osmosis-1", transfer_enabled: true },
      ],
    };

    // Explicitly set feeAmount as an array of coin objects
    const feeAmount = [{ denom: "uom", amount: "5000" }];  // Corrected feeAmount format

    const instantiateReceipt = await client.instantiate(
      account.address,
      codeId,
      initMsg,
      "My Stratocoin Contract",
      { gas: "200000", feeAmount }  // Use the correct feeAmount array format
    );

    const contractAddress = instantiateReceipt.contractAddress;
    console.log(`Contract instantiated at address: ${contractAddress}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during deployment:", error);
  }
}

deploy().catch(console.error);

```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `deployer` folder and add your mnemonic and other environment variables:

```
MNEMONIC="your mnemonic here"
```

### Compile and Deploy the Contract

1. Compile the TypeScript file:
    ```bash
    tsc index.ts
    ```

2. Run the deployment script:
    ```bash
    npx ts-node index.ts
    ```

   This will deploy your CosmWasm contract on the DuKong Testnet.

### Verify Contract Deployment

Once the contract is deployed, you will receive confirmation messages with the contract address and other details. Verify the contract deployment on the **MANTRA Chain Explorer**:

[MANTRA Chain Explorer](https://explorer.mantrachain.io)

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your CosmWasm contract is now deployed on the DuKong Testnet. You can interact with it via the provided contract address on the blockchain.
